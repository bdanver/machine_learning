## Basic ML/Intro
- Machine Learning: Computer algorithms that improve over time and adjust. As computer scientists, we are responsible for creating these algorithms.
- Image classification, ie. dog vs. cat pics. What is the likelihood the presented image is a dog? 
    - convert image to array of numbers
- Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn
## Github 
- Keep things organized in different directories 
- Add files, commit, push 
- Must always connect github to .ipynb 
## Tips for Learning
- Set a learning goal before lesson
- Take notes during 'lecture' then type notes out to publish to repo (this keep things organzied)
- Keep vocab sheet during lesson
- Find example code online and explain what is happening via comments 
- Make small changes to code you already know works, and predict the outcome
